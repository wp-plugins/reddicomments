Allows you to easily add any Reddit comment page into your blog post via a shortcode.

== Description ==
Do you love Reddit-style comments?  Do you submit your blog post to Reddit only to find the discussion there is much more active than the one at your own blog?  Do you wish you could show Reddit comments as they appear on Reddit on your own blog post?

With ReddiComments, you can!  ReddiComments allows you to use a simple shortcode to embed ANY Reddit discussion in your blog posts.

Step 1: Submit your blog post to Reddit  
Step 2: Add this shortcode at the bottom of your blog post:  

[reddiComments link="http://link_to_your_comment_page_on_reddit"]

Step 3: Sit back and join the conversation on Reddit!  

Please note: to get the Reddit comments, this plugin makes an external call to an API hosted at http://reddicomments.com.  The only information it sends this API is the link that you provided - no private information is ever sent to or from the ReddiComments plugin.

== Installation ==
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress (either upload the plugin or search for 'ReddiComments' via the Add New button
2. Add the following shortcode to any blog post (replacing the link with your own Reddit link):

[reddiComments link="http://link_to_your_comment_page_on_reddit"]

3. If you'd like to add a link to Reddit to allow your blog readers an easy way to join the discussion, go to Settings > General > ReddiComments Settings and enable the 'Show link to reddit' checkbox

== Screenshots ==

1. RedditComments show up as they do on Reddit.com.  The link to the discussion on Reddit can be enabled via Settings > General > ReddiComments Settings.
